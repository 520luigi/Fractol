# Fractol
Fractol Project where I create the Mandelbrot, Julia, Burning Ship, and Tricorn Set using mathematical calculations of iterations online. This is another graphics project on the graphics branch at 42. 

This can be used on maco os, because the minilibx library used is for mac os. Run the program by:

```
make
./fractol [fractol number]

#1 Mandelbrot Set
#2 Julia Set
#3 Burning Ship Set
#4 Tricorn Set
